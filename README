Prerequisites / System Requirements) 
	# postgres must be in your PATH (ex: /usr/local/pgsql/bin)

1) To Install, you must specify the PWI variable in Configuration to point to this directory
2) run Install
	# Install will get directory (and sybase library) information from Configuration
	# Then it will install virtualenv with the specified Python install
	# The all 3rd party libraries get installed either by easy_install, or through manual commands
	# sybase connections are tested by hitting mgd and selecting out of mgi_dbinfo
3) run startserver.sh and hope for the best.
	# logs are in nohup.out
4) to debug, you must 'source Configuration' then 'python debugserver.py'
5) to add more sybase databases you need to add them to unixODBC. There is a file in the tdsconf directory that gets loaded on Install. Either re-Install, or look on the unixODBC website to learn how to reload that conf file of datasources.
