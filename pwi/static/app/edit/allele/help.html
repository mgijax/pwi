<h2>P-WI Allele Editor Interface functionality</h2>

<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
The Allele module is a search, display and edit page all in one. A user must be logged in to edit but can search without logging in.
</p>
<h4>Keyboard Short-cuts</h4>
There are reported issues using these short-cuts with Mac/Firefox. 
<ul>
	<li>Search = Ctrl-Alt-S</li>
	<li>Clear = Ctrl-Alt-C</li>
	<li>Modify = Ctrl-Alt-M</li>
	<li>Previous = Ctrl-Alt-P</li>
	<li>Next = Ctrl-Alt-N</li>
</ul>

<h4>Color-coded Labels</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Thistle = search only</li>
        <li>Green = search &amp; edit</li>
        <li>Blue = read-only</li>
        <li>Yellow = current row</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Chrome and FireFox are supported on both PC and Mac computers.</li>
	<li>Safari is NOT supported for the PWI. There are features that do not work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>
All fields that have labels highlighted in blue/green may be used for searching. 
They may be searched individually or in combination. To include data in a tab 
in a search: click on the tab to expand it and enter text to be searched. 
When more than one field is used in a search, it is treated as an AND search.
</p>

<h4>Wildcards</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Wildcards (%) may be used for most fields. </li>
	<li>A wildcard may be used at the beginning, middle and/or end of your search text: e.g. %paired%, casein% or AK32%43%.</li>
</ul> 
 
<h4>Batch Searching Multiple Allele Symbols</h4>
<ul>
<li>A space-separated list of allele symbols, from, for example, a spreadsheet, can be pasted into the Multi Allele Symbols field. 
<li>After clicking the Search button the results will be shown as a table on the right and and the search field will be cleared. 
<li>If a search string is entered in both the Allele Symbol field and the Multi Allele Symbols field, the latter will take precedence. 
<li>Wildcards (%) are not allowed in the Multi Allele Symbols field. 
</ul>

<h4>Search by Dates</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Valid date formats for searching are:
		<ul>
			<li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
			<li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
			<li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Searching for a range of dates:
		<ul>
			<li>equal to: enter a single date</li>
			<li>greater than: &gt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>greater than or equal to: &gt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than: &lt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than or equal to: &lt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>between two dates (inclusive): mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
</ul> 
<h4>Search Data</h4>
<p>When you click on the Search button:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the results are displayed in a table with each row representing a single allele.</li>
	<li>Results are displayed by status (in progress, deleted, and reserved prior to approved or autoloaded) and in alpha-numeric order.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Add New Allele</h3>
<p>Fields required to add a new allele or transgene include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>symbol</li>
	<li>allele name</li>
	<li>marker (required for approved alleles)</li>
	<li>original reference</li>
	<li>generation type</li>
	<li>germ line transmission status</li>
	</ul>
<p>Other fields have defaults such as: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>status (reserved)</li>
	<li>inheritance mode (not applicable)</li>
	<li>collection (not specified)</li>
	<li>mixed (no)</li>
	<li>extinct (no)</li>
	<li>strain of origin (blank for all generation types except gene trapped and targeted that default to not specified).</li>
	<li>The mutant cell line is blank for all generation types except gene trapped and targeted that default to not specified.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Once required data has been entered, select <b>Add</b> in the top right menu.</p>
<h3>Modify Existing Allele</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Fields with green headers can be modified.</li>
	<li>Be sure to select <b>Modify</b> in the top right menu to save changes.</li> 
	<li>Warning: approved alleles must have approved an approved marker and original reference (not J:23000).</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Delete Existing Allele</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Removing an allele from the public can be done through a change in allele status to deleted, reserved, or in progress.</li>
        <li>To expunge the allele, use the delete button.</li>
        <li>However, an allele cannot be deleted if it is associated with GXD, MP, or strain data.</li>
	</ul>
