<h4>Allele Summary functionality:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Wild type alleles are included.</li>
	<li>Sort order: (1)Transmission Status descending (so "Cell Line" comes last), (2)Allele Status, (3)Symbol in ASCII order.</li>
	<li>Only the first 1,000 matching records are displayed. To get all results if more than 1,000 records match, click the "View All Matches" link at the top of each table, or download the tab-delimited file.</li>
	<li>The MP Annotations column has 3 possible values:
	<ul>
		<li>blank - there are no annotations.</li>
		<li>has data - there is at least 1 MP annotation to an "abnormal" term.</li>
		<li>no abnormal phenotype observed - all annotations have the "norm" qualifier.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Disease Annotations column lists ALL disease terms annotated to any genotype involving the allele, including "NOT" annotations.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Allele Summary for a Marker functionality:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The URL supports <em>/pwi/edit/allelesummary?marker_id=MGI:(number)</em></li>
	<li>This summary returns all alleles for a marker with any allele status value. It does not include alleles using "involves" or "expresses" relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Allele Summary for a Reference functionality:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The URL supports <em>/pwi/edit/allelesummary?refs_id=J:(number)</em>
	<li>This summary includes only Alleles with a direct association to the Reference. This includes relationship types: Indexed, Original, Molecular, Transmission, Expression-only, Used-FC, and Not Used.</li>
</ul>
