<h2>P-WI Antibody Editor Interface functionality</h2>

<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
The Antibody module is a display and edit page all in one. A user must be logged in to edit but can search without logging in.

<h4>Keyboard Short-cuts</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Add = Ctrl-Alt-A</li>
        <li>Delete = Ctrl-Alt-D</li>
        <li>Search = Ctrl-Alt-S</li>
        <li>Clear = Ctrl-Alt-C</li>
        <li>Modify = Ctrl-Alt-M</li>
        <li>First = Ctrl-Alt-F</li>
        <li>Previous = Ctrl-Alt-P</li>
        <li>Next = Ctrl-Alt-N</li>
        <li>Last = Ctrl-Alt-L</li>
</ul>

<h4>Color-coded Labels</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Thistle = search only
        <li>Green = edit
                <li>Blue = read only
        <li>Yellow = current row</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Chrome and FireFox are supported on both PC and Mac computers.</li>
        <li>Safari is NOT supported for the PWI. There are features that do not work.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Search by Dates</h4>
<ul>
                <li>Valid date formats for searching are:</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
                        <li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
                        <li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Searching for a range of dates:
                <ul>
                        <li>equal to: enter a single date
                        <li>greater than: &gt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>greater than or equal to: &gt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>less than: &lt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>less than or equal to: &lt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>between two dates (inclusive): mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        </ul>
        </li>
</ul> 
<h4>Searching</h4>
<ul>
        <li>All fields may be used for searching.</li>
        <li>They may be searched individually or in combination. In some, but not all, cases when more than one field is used in a search, it is treated as an AND search.</li>
        <li>A search of the Name field will simultaneously search Names and Aliases. A search of the Alias field will only search Aliases.</li>
        <li>A search with no parameters returns all antibodies.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wildcards</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Wildcards (%) may be used for most fields.</li>
        <li>A wildcard may be used at the beginning, middle and/or end of your search test: e.g. %paired%, casein% or AK32%43%.</li>
</ul> 
 
<h4>Creating New Antibodies</h4>
<ul>
        <li>The fields required to create an antibody are: Name, Antigen ID, and Primary Reference. All other fields are optional.</li>
        <li>Each antibody must have one primary reference; all other references should be type = related.</li>
        <li>Aliases are not required to have a J#; they may be entered without.</li>
        <li>Not all antibodies have an associated gene. These antibodies recognize non-mouse genes, e.g. B-galactosidase and GFP, and are used for in situ reporter assays (knock-in and transgenic) and recombinase reporter assays.  </li>
        <li>The ‘Companies (for Notes)’ field is used to create a note for a commercially available antibody. Start typing a company name, e.g. Santa. The field autofills from a Simple Vocabulary (called 'GXD Antibody Companies'), pick the company, and tab out of the field. A note, 'Antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,' will appear in the notes field.  </li>
	<li>The ‘Companies (for Searching)’ field is used to minimize typing when searching for existing antibodies. Start typing a company name, pick the company from the autofill, and tab out of the field. The company name surrounded by wildcards (%) will appear in the notes field.  </li>
        <li>New antibodies can be created by “copying” existing antibodies.  To do so, pull up the antibody whose values you want to use; deselect it from the search return; add a primary J#; hit Add.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Antigen Information</h4>
<ul>
        <li>The Strain, Tissue and Cell Line are validated fields that have an autofill dropdown to help with entry. New items can be added to this list by clicking <b>yes</b> in the dialogue box when asked.</li>
        <li>The Antigen Source defaults are the same as are used in the probes module.</li>
        <ul>
        	<li>If the organism is not <b>mouse, laboratory</b> or <b>Not Specified</b>, then the strain field default should be <b>Not Applicable</b>.</li>
        	<li>If a Tissue is entered, then the Cell Line field default should be <b>Not Applicable</b>. (Curators can override it, but the default is <b>Not Applicable</b>.)</li>
        	<li>If a Cell Line is entered, then the Age default should be <b>Not Applicable</b>. (If there is some cell line related age information curators wish to record, they should put it in the Tissue Description notes field.)</li>
        </ul>
     	<li>If you choose Organism = <b>Other (see notes)</b>, you must enter explanatory text into the Notes field.</li>
        <li>The Strain, Tissue, and Cell Line field use controlled vocabularies.</li>
        <li>If you try to enter a term that does not currently exist, you will be given a dialogue box asking if you want to proceed. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Strain: existing strains can be viewed in the Strain module.</li>
            <li>Tissue: a dropdown of tissues currently in the source table aids entry into this field; be sure to tab out to ensure the PWI “remembers” your choice.  The entire list of existing tissues can be viewed in the Tissue module.</li>
            <li>Cell Line: the list of existing cell lines can be found here; not all are used: <a href="http://prodwww.informatics.jax.org/data/reports/qcreports_db/output/PRB_CellLine.sql.rpt">Existing Cell Lines Report</a></li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Related References</h4>
<p>There is no specified sort order; they come back in the whatever order the DAO 
gets them from the database. Thus, the most recently added one will be at the 
top of the list (under Primary).
</p>

<h4>Modifying/Updating Antibodies</h4>
<ul>
        <li>All fields with green labels (antibody attributes) can be updated (e.g. name, genes, references, aliases).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deleting Antibodies</h4>
<p>An antibody that is being used by an assay cannot be deleted. You must delete the assay or modify it so that it uses another antibody first.</p>
