<h2>P-WI Antibody Editor Interface functionality</h2>

<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
The Antibody module is a display and edit page all in one. A user must be logged in to edit but can search without logging in.

<h4>Keyboard Short-cuts</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Add = Ctrl-Alt-A</li>
        <li>Delete = Ctrl-Alt-D</li>
        <li>Search = Ctrl-Alt-S</li>
        <li>Clear = Ctrl-Alt-C</li>
        <li>Modify = Ctrl-Alt-M</li>
        <li>First = Ctrl-Alt-F</li>
        <li>Previous = Ctrl-Alt-P</li>
        <li>Next = Ctrl-Alt-N</li>
        <li>Last = Ctrl-Alt-L</li>
</ul>

<h4>Color-coded Labels</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Thistle = search only
        <li>Green = edit
                <li>Blue = read only
        <li>Yellow = current row</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Chrome and FireFox are supported on both PC and Mac computers.</li>
        <li>Safari is NOT supported for the PWI. There are features that do not work.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Search by Dates</h4>
<ul>
                <li>Valid date formats for searching are:</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
                        <li>mm/dd/yy 0r mm-dd-yy<li>
                        <li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Searching for a range of dates:
                <ul>
                        <li>equal to: enter a single date
                        <li>greater than: &gt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>greater than or equal to: &gt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>less than: &lt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>less than or equal to: &lt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        <li>between two dates (inclusive): mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
                        </ul>
        </li>
</ul> 
<h4>Searching</h4>
<ul>
        <li>All fields may be used for searching.</li>
        <li>They may be searched individually or in combination. In some, but not all, cases when more than one field is used in a search, it is treated as an AND search.</li>
        <li>Antigen fields can only be used for searching, creating/modifying an antigen must be done in the antigen module.</li>
        <li>A search of the Name field will simultaneously search Names and Aliases. A search of the Alias field will only search Aliases.</li>
        <li>A search with no parameters returns all antibodies.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wildcards</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Wildcards (%) may be used for most fields.</li>
        <li>A wildcard may be used at the beginning, middle and/or end of your search test: e.g. %paired%, casein% or AK32%43%.</li>
</ul> 
 
<h4>Creating New Antibodies</h4>
<ul>
        <li>The fields required to create an antibody are: Name, Antigen ID, and Primary Reference. All other fields are optional.</li>
        <li>One antigen can be associated with >1 antibody.</li>
        <li>Each antibody must have one primary reference; all other references should be type = related.</li>
        <li>Aliases are not required to have a J#; they may be entered without.</li>
        <li>There are antibodies used in assays that do not have associated genes. These antibodies recognize non-mouse genes, e.g. B-galactosidase and GFP, and are used in knock-in and transgenic in situ reporter assays, as well as in recombinase reporter assays.</li>
                <li>The 'companies' field is used to create a note. Start typing a company name, e.g. Santa. The field autofills from a Simple Vocabulary called 'GXD Antibody Companies'. 'Santa Cruz Biotechnology' will appear, pick it. Tab out of the Companies field and 'Antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.' appears in the notes field.</li>
        <li>New antibodies can be created by “copying” existing antibodies.  To do so, pull up the antibody whose values you want to use; deselect it from the search return; add a primary J#; hit Add.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Related References</h4>
<p>There is no specified sort order; they come back in the whatever order the DAO 
gets them from the database. Thus, the most recently added one will be at the 
top of the list (under Primary).
</p>

<h4>Modifying/Updating Antibodies</h4>
<ul>
        <li>All fields with green labels (antibody attributes) can be updated (e.g. name, antigen id, genes, references, aliases).</li>
        <li>Antigen attributes (purple labels) can only be updated in the antigen module.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deleting Antibodies</h4>
<p>An antibody that is being used by an assay cannot be deleted. You must delete the assay or modify it so that it uses another antibody first.</p>
