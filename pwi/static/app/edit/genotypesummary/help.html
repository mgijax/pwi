<h4>Genotype Summary for Clipboard Functionality:</h4>
<ul>
<li>All genotypes listed on the user's clipboard are included.</li>
<li>Sorted as on the clipboard.</li>
<li>Yesâ€™es in the Annotations columns are based on any annotations using the genotype, not solely those derived from the reference.</li>
<li>The summary logic does not use the expression cache. This means genotypes appear on the summary once they are annotated to specimens/gel lanes; it is not necessary that the results are annotated.</li>
<li>Genotype results are paginated - 250 results per page. Results may also be downloaded as a tab-delimited file.</li>
<li>The URL supports /pwi/edit/genotypesummary/?user_id=username</li>
</ul>
