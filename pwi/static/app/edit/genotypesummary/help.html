<h4>Genotype Summary for Genotype Module Search Results Functionality:</h4>
<ul>User does a search, then clicks Search Summary button.
<li>All genotypes listed on the search results box are included in the summary.</li>
<li>Top of the summary lists the MGI ID's for all records in the search results.</li>
<li>Sort is based on the order from the 'searched by' ID list, so it matches the sort of the results.</li>
<li>Yes’es in the Annotations columns are based on any annotations using the genotype, not solely those derived from the reference.</li>
<li>The summary logic does not use the expression cache. This means genotypes appear on the summary once they are annotated to specimens/gel lanes; it is not necessary that the results are annotated.</li>
<li>Genotype results are paginated - 250 results per page. Results may also be downloaded as a tab-delimited file.</li>
<li>The URL supports /pwi/edit/genotypesummary/?accid=MGI:#######,MGI:######,etc.</li>
</ul>
