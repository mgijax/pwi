			"description": "Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) have relative genomic stability and relatively benign clinical behavior but whether these two are related causally is unknown. To investigate the effects of introducing genomic instability into murine BCCs, we have compared ionizing radiation-induced tumorigenesis in Ptch1+/- mice vs. that in Ptch1+/- mice carrying mutant Blm alleles. We found that BCCs in Ptch1+/- Blmtm3Brd/tm3Brd mice had a trend towards greater genomic instability as measured by array CGH and that these mice developed significantly more microscopic BCCs than did Ptch1+/- Blm+/tm3Brd or Ptch1+/- Blm+/+ mice. The mutant Blm alleles also markedly enhanced the formation of rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), another cancer to which Ptch1+/- mice and PTCH1+/- (basal cell nevus syndrome) patients are susceptible. Highly recurrent but different copy number changes were associated with the two tumor types and included losses of chromosomes 4 and 10 in all BCCs and gain of chromosome 10 in 80% of RMSs. Loss of chromosome 11 and 13, including the Trp53 and Ptch1 loci respectively, occurred frequently in BCCs, suggesting tissue-specific selection for genes or pathways that collaborate with Ptch deficiency in tumorigenesis. Despite the quantitative differences, there was no dramatic qualitative difference in the BCC or RMS tumors associated with the mutant Blm genotype. We investigated the effect of Blm deficiency on ionizing radiation-induced basal cell carcinoma and rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis in Ptch1+/- mice. Six BCC and five RMS samples were obtained from separate mice. Liver tissue from each mouse was used as the normal reference.",

			"description": "Ammonium is a waste product that inhibits cell growth, recombinant protein production, and protein glycosylation in mammalian cell culture. Recent studies have demonstrated that ammonium adversely affects glycosylation-related gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, since the CHO cell line species has not been fully sequenced, a glycosylation transcriptome analysis is not possible in this cell line. Therefore, to further understand the effects of ammonium on glycosylation-related gene expression, NS0 cells, a mouse myeloma cell line, were cultured under elevated ammonium. NS0 cells are similar to CHO cells, in that the NS0 cells are anchorage-independent and commonly used to commercially produce recombinant proteins. Additionally, DNA microarrays containing all known mouse glycosylation-related genes were available to be used to examine gene expression. NS0 cells were cultured under normal (control), elevated ammonium, elevated salt, and elevated ammonium with proline. It was observed that the control and treatments culture growth rates were not significantly different; however, the final cell densities were significantly different. The DNA microarray data was analyzed using a Welch ANOVA test with a Benjamini and Hochberg False discovery rate correction for the multiple comparisons of the glycosylation-genes. No significant difference in gene expression levels between the four conditions examined were observed. The results of this study demonstrated that NS0 cells, at the gene expression level, are insensitive to ammonium. Thus, the decreased glycosylation observed in NS0 cell cultures at elevated ammonium is likely due to changes in synthesis and degradation enzyme activity. In contrast, CHO cells have decreased glycosylation levels due to decreased sialytransferase gene expression and not increased degradation enzyme activity. Therefore, even though NS0 and CHO cells are both commonly used recombinant hosts for glycoprotein synthesis, it appears that NS0 and CHO cells had different control mechanisms respect to glycosylation-related gene expression under elevated ammonium. NS0 cells (ECACC#85110503), originally from the European Collection of Cell Culture, were donated to Clemson University by Merck, Inc. NS0 cells are a mouse myeloma cell line with lymphoblast morphology, non-secreting clone, and cholesterol auxotroph. NS0 cells cultured under four conditions were examined: Control (C), Ammonium-Stressed (A), Salt-Stressed (S), and Ammonium-Stressed with Proline added to mitigate the negative effects of ammonium (P). Triplicates of each condition were used. The cultures were be monitored during the normal batch growth phase. To identify genes sensitive to ammonium in growing cultures, the 90-h time point was selected for RNA isolation and gene expression analysis. Other culture parameters that were monitored include: Cell density, viability, and glucose.",
