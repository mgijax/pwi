<h4>P-WI Accession Query and Summary functionality:</h4>

<p>When a (comma-delimited) list of supported accession IDs is entered, a summary of matching results is returned. Each object is linked to its Detail Page.  Because of the variety of object types which may be returned, only the ID and the MGI Type are listed in the summary.</p>
<p>Values which do not match an ID for one of the objects listed below are ignored. A query which finds a match to a single accession ID takes the user directly to the Detail Page for that object.</p>

Supported objects and their accession ID formats include:
<ul>
	<li>Reference - J:(number)</li>
	<li>Marker - MGI:(number)</li>
	<li>Probe - MGI:(number)</li>
	<li>Mapping experiment (only select experiment types) - MGI:(number)</li>
	<li>Antibody - MGI:(number)</li>
	<li>Assay (GXD or Cre) - MGI:(number)</li>
	<li>Image (GXD or Cre) - MGI:(number)</li>
	<li>Allele - MGI:(number)</li>
	<li>GO term - GO:(number)</li>
	<li>MP term - MP:(number)</li>
