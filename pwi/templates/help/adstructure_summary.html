<h4>AD Structure Query and Summary Results Functionality:</h4>

AD Structure Summary Results URLs supported include:
<ul>
	<li><em>/pwi/summary/adstructure?structure_text=(inputString)&amp;theiler_stages=(value)&amp;theiler_stages=(value)...</em> </li>
	<li><em>/pwi/summary/adstructure?structure_text=(inputString)</em> - if only text for searching in Structures is submitted.</li>
	<li><em>/pwi/summary/adstructure?structure_text=&amp;theiler_stages=(value)</em> - if a single Theiler Stage is submitted. </li>
</ul>

Functionality:
<ul>
	<li>The "You Searched For" section echoes any Structures input text string and Theiler Stage(s) from the user's query.</li>
	<li>Text searching is "contains". Searching for "ear" will also return "heart".</li>
	<li>The input string is searched in Structure terms and Synonyms.  Matching text is displayed in boldface wherever it occurs (Structure or Synonym). </li>
	<li>Synonyms are displayed for all Structures returned, even if the Synonym does not contain text matching the search string.</li>
	<li>Results are returned ordered by (1) Theiler Stage, (2) Structure (alphabetical order).</li>
	<li>The MGI ID of the Structure is linked to an AD Structure (vocabulary term) Detail page.</li>
	<li>A "Search Again" input form appears on every Summary and Detail page to allow searching for a new text string. Text is searched in all Theiler Stages when using this form.</li>
</ul>
