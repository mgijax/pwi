	<li>Notes are displayed as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Molecular Note: displayed as HTML.
		<li>Nomenclature Note (private): displayed verbatim.
		<li>General Note: displayed as HTML (because newer notes may contain links, tables and other HTML tags).
		<li>Marker Detail clip: displayed as HTML.
	</ul>

TEST CASES:
MGI:1856265 has a Strain of Origin but no cell line data
MGI:5007022, MGI:5552944 have General Note with HTML; MGI:3717809 has General Note with MGI markup superscript which displays badly - needs cleanup.
