<h4>P-WI Allele Detail Functionality:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The Allele Detail page displays data for any allele in the Allele tables.</li>
	<li>The URL supports <em>/detail/allele/MGI:(number)</em> or <em>/detail/allele/key/(number)</em>.</li>
	<li>Notes are displayed as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Molecular Note: displayed as HTML.
		<li>Nomenclature Note (private): displayed as HTML.
		<li>General Note: displayed as HTML (because newer notes may contain links, tables and other HTML tags).
		<li>Marker Detail clip: displayed as HTML.
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>Summary Links:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>References - includes only references where the allele is directly associated via relationship types: Indexed, Original, Molecular, Transmission, Expression-only, Used-FC, and Not Used.</li>
	<li>Expression Assays - includes all GXD and Cre assays where the allele is included in the associated genotype.</li> 
	<li>Images - includes all Molecular and Phenotypes images associated directly with the allele or through a genotype.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Annotations (MP and OMIM):</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Genotypes are ordered by a database sequence number. This order resembles but does not exactly match Public in all cases.</li>
	<li>If a Primary Image is associated, the thumbnail file and the thumbnail caption are displayed.
	<li>Anatomical Systems order matches that specified in the database (same as in the EI and on Public).</li>
	<li>Annotated MP terms: order DOES NOT match Public; NO indentation yet. (Sorry. We will get to it...)</li>
	<li>MP annotations with the "norm" qualifier display "(normal)" next to the annotated term.</li>
	<li>MP terms within a System are displayed only once (even if multiple paths exist). Terms are ordered by "DAG Sequence Number" which resembles but does not exactly match Public in all cases.</li>
	<li>For each annotated term, References (J:#s) are listed ordered by the references key (this might be same as Public, not sure). Notes are then listed under the associated Reference. (Example: genotype a<sup>m</sup>/a MGI:4829948).</li>
	<li>All 3 Note Types (General, Normal, and Background Sensitivity) are displayed. As on Public, "Background Sensitivity" notes are so labeled.  Different from Public, but for curation purposes, "normal" notes are so labeled. (Example: genotype Ccl2<sup>tm1Rol</sup>/ Ccl2<sup>tm1Rol</sup> MGI:4418564)</li>
	<li>Sex-specific annotations are indicated as "(Sex: M)" or "(Sex: F)" (Example: allele Ty MGI:1856639).</li>
	<li>OMIM annotations with the "NOT" qualifier display "(NOT)" next to the term. (Example: allele Prnp<sup>tm1Edin</sup> MGI:1934274)</li>
</ul>

TEST CASES:
MGI:1856265 has a Strain of Origin but no cell line data
MGI:5007022, MGI:5552944 have General Note with HTML; MGI:3717809 has General Note with MGI markup superscript which displays badly - needs cleanup.
MGI:5426386 has status In Progress and has 2 values for Molecular Mutation, none for Allele Attribute.
MGI:5427353 has status In Progress and has 1 value for Molecular Mutation, 2 values for Allele Attribute.
MGI:4950575 has status Reserved, complicated symbol, Molecular Note and General Note containing HTML.
MGI:5575637 has status Reserved, 2 values for Molecular Mutation; General Note and Molecular Note needing cleanup (trying to interpret at HTML hides some data.
MGI:5007713 has "<s>" in General Note causing "strikeout" for remainder of page.
MGI:1856424 Lep<ob> has both types of images; Strain of Origin but no cell lines. Image captions need AlleleSymbol Notes Tag Converter applied. Nomen Note needs curator cleanup (if desired).
MGI:4071391 Marker Detail Clip includes HTML.
MGI:1934631, MGI:2136412 have image, MGI:2176073, MGI:2176173 have 3+, but NO primary for allele. Need to fix this later.
