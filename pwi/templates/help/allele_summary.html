<h4>Allele Summary functionality:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Wild type alleles are included.</li>
	<li>Sort order: (1)Transmission Status descending (so "Cell Line" comes last), (2)Allele Status, (3)Symbol in ASCII order.</li>
	<li>Only the first 1,000 matching records are displayed. To get all results if more than 1,000 records match, click the "View All Matches" link at the top of each table.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Allele Summary for a Marker functionality:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The URL supports <em>/pwi/summary/allele?marker_id=MGI:(number)</em></li>
	<li>This summary returns all alleles for a marker with any allele status value. It does not include alleles using "involves" or "expresses" relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Allele Summary for a Reference functionality:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>This summary includes only Alleles with a direct association to the Reference. This includes relationship types: Indexed, Original, Molecular, Transmission, Expression-only, Used-FC, and Not Used.</li>
</ul>
