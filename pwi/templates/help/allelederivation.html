<h2>P-WI Allele Derivation Editor Interface functionality</h2>

<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
The Allele Derivation module is a search, display and edit page all in one. A user must be logged in to edit but can search without logging in.

</p><h4>Keyboard Short-cuts</h4>
There are reported issues using these short-cuts with Mac/Firefox. 
<ul>
	<li>Search = Ctrl-Alt-S</li>
	<li>Clear = Ctrl-Alt-C</li>
	<li>Modify = Ctrl-Alt-M</li>
	<li>Previous = Ctrl-Alt-P</li>
	<li>Next = Ctrl-Alt-N</li>
	
</ul>

<h4>Color-coded Labels</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Thistle = search only
        <li>Green = search & edit
        <li>Blue = read-only
        <li>Yellow = current row</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Chrome and FireFox are supported on both PC and Mac computers.</li>
	<li>Safari is NOT supported for the PWI. There are features that do not work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>
All fields that have labels highlighted in blue/green may be used for searching. 
They may be searched individually or in combination. To include data in a tab 
in a search: click on the tab to expand it and enter text to be searched. 
When more than one field is used in a search, it is treated as an AND search.
</p>

<h4>Search by Dates</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Valid date formats for searching are:
		<ul>
			<li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
			<li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
			<li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Searching for a range of dates:
		<ul>
			<li>equal to: enter a single date</li>
			<li>greater than: &gt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>greater than or equal to: &gt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than: &lt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than or equal to: &lt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>between two dates (inclusive): mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Adding a derivation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minimal information required to add a new derivation includes: Derivation Type (select from list), Creator (select from list), Vector name (type in exactly or select from the list on the right below PCL), and Vector Type (select from list). Additionally, PCL can be typed in exactly or selected from the list on the right.</li>
<li>Alternative, an existing derivation can be searched for then deselected, modified and added as a new derivation.</li>
<li>The J# is not required to add a derivation. The field remains bank if no J# is entered.</li>
<li>If the derivation already exists, you will receive a warning to that effect and the duplicate derivation will not be added.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Modifying a derivation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fields that can be modified within the field: J#, Creator, Vector Name (must match one on pick list), Vector Type. Note that PCL, PCL strain and Cell Line Type can only be modified by selecting a different PCL from the menu on the right. Note that you cannot type in and modify thistle colored boxes.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deleting a derivation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to delete a derivation associated with one or more mutant cell lines is not allowed and will generate a warning. First removed mutant cell lines associated with the derivation in order to be allowed to delete the derivation.</li>
