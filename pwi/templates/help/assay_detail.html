<h4>P-WI Assay Detail functionality:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The Assay Detail page displays data for any assay in the GXD tables - both GXD and Cre assay types.</li>
	<li>The URL supports <em>/detail/assay/MGI:(number)</em> or <em>/detail/assay/key/(number)</em>.</li>
	<li>Thumbnail images, gel assay image labels, and the "Figure Label" column of in situ assays are linked to the appropriate Image Detail page.</li>
	<li>Conditional gentoypes are indicated by text "(conditional)" below the allele pairs for a Specimen (in situs) or a Lane (blots).</li>
	<li>Age values are displayed as saved in the database. Code does not use logic to translate into abbreviations as on Public.</li>
</ul>
Notes fields:
<ul>
	<li>Three notes fields are displayed "translated" as they would be on public for GXD pages and for Cre pages. Hover your mouse pointer over the Label to see how the note text is being translated (verbatim, "HTML-enabled" (interprets angle brackets as HTML tags), MGI-markup (interprets angle brackets as indicating superscript) and/or using Notes Tag converter).
		<ul>
		<li>Assay Notes</li>
		<li>Specimen Notes</li>
		<li>Result Notes</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Notes translated in the format of Cre Public WI pages are <span style="color:#777777;">displayed in gray font color</span>.</li>
	<li>Blot data are displayed as simply as possible. Notes data are not associated with a "footnote" but are displayed in separate tables below the results table. These include:
		<ul>
		<li>Age Notes </li>
		<li>Row Notes </li>
		<li>Band Notes </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Blot lane labels are translated from MGI markup (angle brackets for superscript). Code uses logic to supply lane numbers when no text label is found. Numbers correspond to "Lane" numbers in Notes below the results table.</li>
	<li>When 2 or more rows are present, blot rows are numbered in results table column headers.  Numbers correspond to "Gelrow" numbers in Notes below the results table.</li>
	<li>A lane having one or more Band Notes is indicated by an asterisk in a column between the Lane Note and Age Note columns.  Band Notes are displayed in a table below the results table.</li>
</ul>
