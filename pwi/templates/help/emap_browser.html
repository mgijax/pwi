<h4>EMAP Browser Functionality</h4>

<h5>Term Search</h5>
<ul>
	<li>
	Search without wild cards brings back only the term. This is not a contains search. <span class="example">e.g.  embryo mesenchyme</span>
	</li>
 	<li>
	The search will recognize numbers, space, hyphen, slash, and comma as regular characters.  i.e. they aren't ignored
 	</li>
 	<li>
	Semi-colon (;) is a delimiter for multiple search terms -<span class="example">example search 'liver; brain; heart'</span>
	</li>
	<li>
		% is a wild card
		<br/>Examples:
		<ul>
		  <li class="example">dorsal r%</li>
		  <li class="example">%arch</li>
		  <li class="example">Laryn% tissue</li>
		  <li class="example">Resp% vess%</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	The search term is bolded in the return
	</li>
	<li>
	Sort order is alphabetical
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Term Detail</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Term detail includes
	  <ul>
	    <li>the ID and name</li>
	    <li>synonyms</li>
	    <li>the Theiler stage range</li>
	    <li>list of direct parents (terms and relationships)</li>
	    <li>is EMAPA view</li>
	  </ul>
	  *Secondary ids are not displayed
	</li>
	<li>Clicking parent terms will update the term detail section</li>
	<li>1st search item in the return will be displayed in term detail section</li>
</ul>

<h5>Window Resizing</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Clipboard bottom and right side are adjustable.</li>
	<li>Tree section bottom is adjustable.</li>
	<li>Term detail section bottom flexes based on synonyms, parents, etc., but isn't manually resizable.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Clipboard behavior</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Each user has their own clipboard in the database. This allows our persistent clipboard, i.e. things remain in the clipboard until removed/cleared.</li>
	<li>Curators can't add to or see the clipboard if not logged in. (it's disabled)</li>
	<li>Any interaction with the clipboard refreshes it.</li>
	<li>Display format is TS#; term. (e.g. "TS10; embryo")</li>
	<li>Added term (or terms) are appended to the end of the clipboard.</li>
	<li>User can remove specified items using the small 'x' next to each term.</li>
	<li>'sort' button is by stage then alpha; 'Delete all' button clears the clipboard; 'Refresh' button updates the clipboard with changes from the EI (e.g. curator uses the 'add assay structures to clipboard' button in the assay ei).</li>
	<li>Duplicate stage entries from the input (i.e. "10,10,12,13") go into the clipboard only once.</li>
	<li>We only add new entries if they don't alreadt exist in the clipboard.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Adding to clipboard</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The curator searches for EMAPA terms, selects one (or the first is auto-selected); and enters stages into the clipboard field.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Can add current term in detail area + one or more stages.</li>
		<li>Curator can enter ranges (e.g. 20-24), lists (e.g. 21,25,28), or just "*" for "all stages"</li>
		<li>Clicks "Add to clipboard" button (or just hits ENTER)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>EMAPA term/stage pairs added to curator's clipboard in the database and is reflected in the clipboard section of both the EMAPA module and the Assay module.</li>
	<li>There is an error message for invalid stage entry, invalid stage range, or when you "add" when the input box is empty.</li>
	<li>There is no change to the input value when you switch terms or after you finish an "add".</li>
</ul>

<h5>EMAPA Load</h5>
<li>The EMAPA ontology is edited in OBO-Edit. Loading EMAPA into the database is done incrementally based on matching indentifiers in the input with those in the database- it isn't a drop and re-load.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Existing terms may be updated; new terms may be created; old terms might be deleted (e.g., because of a merge)</li>
	<li>The is-a and part-of relationships are drop and reload.</li>
	<li>Any annotation migration (e.g. due to a merge) will be done manually.</li>
	<li>It will be considered an error if an EMAPA update attempts to delete a term that is referenced by an annotation.</li>
	<li>It is and error if astage range contraction results in invalid EMAPA+TS annotations.</li>
	<li>The load also handles changing the dag structure (by virtue of dropping/reloading all term-to-term relationships)</li>
</ul>
