<h3>GXD High-Throughput Experiment Evaluation & Curation</h4>
<h4>Experiment Evaluation</h4>
<h5>Keyboard Shortcuts</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Search = Ctrl-Alt-S</li>
    <li>Clear = Ctrl-Alt-C</li>
    <li>Modify = Ctrl-Alt-M</li>
    <li>Previous = Ctrl-Alt-P</li>
    <li>Next = Ctrl-Alt-N</li>
    <li>Last = Ctrl-Alt-L</li>
    <li>Refresh (Update) Clipboard = Ctrl-Alt-U (refreshes both clipboards simultaneously)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Color-coded Labels</h5>

<ul>
    <li>Thistle = fields that may be searched (but not modified)</li>
    <li>Green = fields that may be searched or modified by the Curator</li>
    <li>Blue = Read-only fields</li>
    <li>Yellow = Action buttons</li>
</ul>

<h5>Curation Status Fields</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluation = The relevance classifier flags experiments as Predicted Yes or Predicted No. Experiments lacking samples are entered into GXD as Not Evaluated. The GXD Curator flags an Experiment for later curation (Yes, Maybe) or as inappropriate for GXD (No).  
        This field is not displayed on Public and does not determine whether Experiments are moved to Public.</li>
    <li>Curation State =  This field is set by the software and not the Curator.  
        Once an Experiment has curated samples, the Curation State is updated to Done.  
        Experiments with a Curation State = Done are moved to the Public WI. When the curated sample table is deleted, the Curation State reverts to Not Done. Experiments with an Evaluation status = No have a Curation State = Not Applicable.    
    </li>  
</ul>

<h5>ID Fields for an Experiment</h5>
<ul>
    <li>ArrayExp = experiment ID from ArrayExpress; you may link to the repository entry for this experiment using the icon to the right of the input box.</li>
    <li>GEO = experiment ID from GEO; you may link to the repository entry for this experiment using the icon to the right of the input box.</li>
    <li>PubMed = publication ID; you may click on this ID to link to PubMed; there may be 0-n PubMed IDs and this count is displayed next to the label. "Pub Med: n".  To add (or remove) ids, click on the X, make changes and then modify; multiples can be separated by any white space delimiter (space/tab/carriage return).  Click on link to PubMed to verify id correctly entered.
</ul>

<h5>Experiment Fields (Green)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Title = A Curator may modify the Title.</li>
    <li>Description = A Curator may modify the Description.</li>
    <li>Experiment Note = A text field used at the discretion of the Curator.  This text is displayed in the WI when curated samples are present; otherwise, it is used as a private notes field.</li>
    <li>Experiment Type = A Curator may modify the Experiment Type.  The initial value displayed in the "Green" Experiment Type is set by the Load.  The value(s) displayed in the "Grey" Experiment Type are downloaded from ArrayExpress. (The "gray" field is not present in GEO).</li>
    <li>Study Type = A Curator selects the appropriate Study Type of the Experiment when curating the sample Data.  The load sets this field to "Not Curated".</li>
    <li>Experimental Variables = The items listed are defined in a Simple Vocabulary, the abbreviations are used to save space.  A Curator may select 0-to-many terms.  The load sets this field to "Not Curated".</li>
</ul>

<h5>Experiment Fields (Blue)</h5> 
<ul>
<li>Experimental Factor = as determined by ArrayExpress curators; not present in GEO.</li>
<li>Experiment Type = raw value(s) as downloaded from ArrayExpress or GEO. Field can be searched using the pWI Custom Report: GXD HT Experiment Properties Search. </li>
<li>Providers = name(s) of those who submitted the experiment to ArrayExpress. This information can be found in GEO but is not easily parsed (so we omitted it).</li>
</ul>

<h5>Date Fields</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Creation in GXD = Date this experiment was loaded in the GXD database.</li>
    <li>Release = Date set by ArrayExpress/GEO</li>
    <li>Last update = Date set by ArrayExpress (not present in GEO).</li>
    <li>Evaluated = Most recent date that the Evaluation Status was modified.  </li>
    <li>Initial Curation = Date the first curation of this Experiment's samples occurs.</li>
    <li>Last Curation = Most recent date that the curated sample Data was modified.</li>
    <li>Modifications to any other curated Experiment fields are not tracked by any date field, e.g. Title, Study Type, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Search by Dates (Creation in GXD, Release, Evaluated, Initial Curation, etc)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Valid date formats:
    <ul><li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
        <li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
        <li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Searching for a range of dates:
    <ul><li>equal to:  enter a single date</li>
        <li>greater than:  > mm/dd/yyyy</li>
        <li>greater than or equal to:  >= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
        <li>less than:  < mm/dd/yyyy</li>
        <li>less than or equal to:  <= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
        <li>between two dates (inclusive):  mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>Search with Wildcards</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The wildcard character is %.</li>
    <li>You may append or prepend the wildcard (%) to your search text.</li>
    <li>A wildcard may be used in text, date, and ID searches.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Samples - Raw & Curated</h4>

<h5>Raw Samples:</h5>

<ul>
   <li>These fields and values are downloaded from GEO and stored in the database.</li>
   <li>Clicking on the Download sample metadata link will display them.</li>
   <li>The fields and values vary between experiments; there is no standardization.</li>
   <li>The raw sample data for experiments from ArrayExpress is not stored in the database.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Sample Summary</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Clicking on the "Show Sample Summary" link above the sample curation table will open a table.</li>
    <li>This table shows the curated data in a compact form, making it easy to proof/review.</li>
    <li>The sample sort is a quick and dirty approximation of that used in the front end. The primary sort is 
    Relevance=Yes (pushing curated mouse samples to the top) and then alphabetical by EMAPS term such that the lowest TS will appear at the top of the table. Non-curated samples are displayed below the relevant ones, sorted by name. </li>
    <li>Clicking on the row number allows you to toggle between the curation and summary tables (to make it easier to fix the errors you find!).</li>
</ul>

<h5>Creation of Samples</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Creation of samples happens when 2 actions occur: clicking on the "Curate Samples" link and clicking on "Modify".  Once these
        actions are taken this experiment and its samples are moved to the Public WI.</li>
    <li>Clicking on the "Curate Samples" link displays a table of fields to be curated.  A Curator may alter the columns displayed
        by checking/unchecking boxes.  These selections are maintained until another experiment is selected.</li>
    <li>If a Curator selects a different experiment before saving one that is in progress -- no samples are saved.</li>
    
</ul>

<h5>Deletion of Samples</h5>
<ul>
    <li>There is a link below the curated sample table that allows you to delete it.</li>
    <li>Doing so will reset the curation status to Not Done.</li>
    <li>The Last Curation By and date fields will reflect when the deletion was executed.</li>
    
</ul>

<h5>Sample Fields & Validation</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Name: for experiments from GEO, the GSM number will be used. For experiments from ArrayExpress, the system chose Source Name, followed by Assay Name or Extract Name if the Source Name did not exist. The curator cannot modify this field.</li>
    <li>Organism:  selection from pull-down list of controlled vocabulary. New choices are added using the Organism module.</li>
    <li>GXD Relevant?:  selection from pull-down of controlled vocabulary. By default this column is hidden.</li>
    <li>Genotype: Genotype ID entered with or without "MGI:"; validation and display of genotype when clicking or tabbing out.</li>
    <li>Age Unit: selection from pull-down of controlled vocabulary</li>
    <li>Age Range: free-form text field; warning in place for entry; the warning is displayed as a red outline of the Age Range input box.</li>
    <li>Sex: selection from pull-down of controlled vocabulary</li>
    <li>EMAPS: term selected from the clipboard or ID entered. Only one ID allowed. Validation performed when tabbing out.  Reset to blank by clicking out. Although this is not a required field, the curatorial policy is that curated samples have an associated structure.</li>
    <li>Cell type: term selected from the clipboard or ID entered. Only one ID allowed. Validation performed when tabbing out. Reset to blank by clicking out. This is not a required field. By default this column is hidden. If content present, number will appear beside column header, indicating the number of samples that contain a note.</li>
    <li>Note: optional free form text field. By default this column is hidden. If content present, number will appear beside column header, indicating the number of samples that contain a note.</li>
</ul>

<h5>User Interface features</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Toggle columns on/off: available for curated and raw columns either by check box or X at top of column.</li>
    <li>Column sort: available for curated and raw columns</li>
    <li>Filters: available for raw columns only</li>
    <li>Clipboard: updates to the EMAPA and Cell Type clipboards are recognized once the Refresh Clipboard link is clicked or the keyboard shortcut executed.</li>
    <li>Copy Up/Down: available for curated columns; clicking on an arrow replicates the value from that cell for all cells above or below (depending on which arrow used).</li>
    <li>Copy from Above: available for curated columns; tabbing out of a field pulls in the value from the nearest cell above with a value.</li>

</ul>

<h4>GXD HT Experiment Load Overview</h4>
<p>
This is an incremental load of high-throughput experiments from GEO.  These are being loaded for the purpose
of indexing some of them using standard vocabularies for the meta data of the experiment and samples.  It is expected that users will query GXD to 
find interesting experiments, but will go to the source for the details of the expression data generated by the experiment itself. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only experiments for Mus and select assay types are loaded.</li>
    <li>The load runs on a weekly schedule.</li>
    <li>The load includes a relevance classifier which sets experiments to a status of "Predicted Yes" or "Predicted No".</li> 
    <li>GXD Curators will triage the newly loaded experiments to determine if the samples should be indexed (Yes, No, Maybe).</li>
    <li>Once loaded into the MGI database experiments are not updated via the Experiment Load with one exception:  the PubMed ID field may be updated if new values are detected at ArrayExpress or GEO.</li>
</ul>
