<h4>GXD High-throughput Evaluation</h4>

<h5>Keyboard Shortcuts</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Search = Ctrl/Alt S</li>
    <li>Clear = Ctrl/Alt C</li>
    <li>Modify = Ctrl/Alt M</li>
	<li>Previous = Ctrl/Alt P</li>
	<li>Next = Ctrl/Alt N</li>
	<li>Last = Ctrl/Alt L</li>
</ul>

<h5>Color-coded Labels</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Blue/Green = fields that may be searched (but not modified).</li>
	<li>Green = fields that may be searched or modified by the Curator.</li>
	<li>Blue = read only fields</li>
	<li>Yellow = action buttons</li>
</ul>

<h5>Curation Status Fields</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluation = The primary curated field for Experiments.  The GXD Curator will determine whether or not they want to curate the Samples of this Experiment (Yes, No, Maybe).  
        This field is not displayed anywhere and does not determine whether Experiments are moved to Public.</li>
    <li>Curation State =  This field is set by the software and cannot be modified by the Curator.  Experiments with a Curation State = Done are moved to the Public WI.  
        Once an Experiment has curated samples -- the Curation State is updated to Done.  Until there is an ability to delete Samples (future enhancement) a Curator is unable to revert the state 
        to "Not Done".  Once the Curation State = Done the value of Evaluation State is irrelevant.</li>  
</ul>

<h5>ID Fields for an Experiment</h5>
<ul>
    <li>ArrayExp = experiment ID from ArrayExpress; you may link to this ID using the icon to the right of the input box.</li>
    <li>GEO = experiment ID from GEO; you may link to this ID using the icon to the right of the input box.</li>
    <li>PubMed = publication ID; you may click on this ID to link to PubMed; there may be 0-n PubMed IDs and this count is displayed next to the label. "Pub Med: n" 
</ul>

<h5>Curated Experiment Fields (Green)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Title = A Curator may modify the Title; likely will be limited to infrequent typo corrections as this field will be displayed in the Public WI.</li>
	<li>Description = A Curator may modify the Description; likely will be limited to infrequent typo corrections as this field will be displayed in the Public WI.</li>
	<li>Experiment Note = A text field used at the discretion of the Curator.  This text is displayed in the WI when present.</li>
	<li>Experiment Type = A Curator may modify the Experiment Type.  The value displayed in the "Green" Experiment Type is the one that the Load set.  The value(s) displayed in the "Grey" Experiment Type are the ones downloaded from ArrayExpress.</li>
	<li>Study Type = A Curator selects the appropriate Study Type of the Experiment when curating the Sample Data.  The load sets this field to "Not Curated".</li>
	<li>Experimental Variables = The items listed are defined in a Simple Vocabulary, the abbreviations are used to save space.  A Curator may select 0-to-many terms.  The load sets this field to "Not Curated".</li>
</ul>

<h5>Date Fields</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Creation in GXD = Date this experiment was loaded in the MGD database.</li>
    <li>Release = Date set by ArrayExpress</li>
    <li>Last update = Date set by ArrayExpress</li>
    <li>Evaluated = Most recent date that the Evaluation Status was modified.  Modifications to any other curated Experiment fields not tracked by this date field (e.g. Title, Study Type, etc).</li>
    <li>Initial Curation = Date the first curation of this Experiment's Samples occurs.</li>
    <li>Last Curation = Most recent date that the curated Sample Data was modified.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Search by Dates (Creation in GXD, Release, Evaluated, Initial Curation, etc)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Valid date formats:
	<ul><li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
	    <li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
	    <li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Searching for a range of dates:
	<ul><li>equal to:  enter a single date</li>
	    <li>greater than:  > mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>greater than or equal to:  >= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>less than:  < mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>less than or equal to:  <= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>between two dates (inclusive):  mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>Search with Wildcards</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The wildcard character is %.</li>
    <li>You may append or prepend the wildcard (%) to your search text.</li>
    <li>A wildcard may be used in text, date, and ID searches.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Consolidation of Samples</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Display of consolidated samples vs. un-consolidated ones</li>
    <li>Display of multiple values for consolidated samples</li>

</ul>


<h5>Curating Sample Data</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Display of raw sample data</li>
    <li>Display of curated sample columns</li>
    <li>Curated sample defaults</li>
    <li>UI features (column sort, filters)</li>
    <li>Sample validation</li>
    <li>Using the Clipboard</li>
    <li>Copy Up/Down</li>
    <li>Copy from Above</li>

</ul>

<h5>GXD HT Experiment Load Overview</h5>
<p>
This is an incremental load of high-throughput experiments from ArrayExpress.  These are being loaded for the purpose
of indexing some of them using standard vocabularies for the meta data of the experiment.  It is expected that users will query GXD to 
find interesting experiments, but will go to the source for the details of the experiment itself. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only experiments for mouse are loaded.</li>
    <li>The load runs on a regular schedule (TBD - monthly/weekly?).</li>
	<li>Most of the newly loaded experiments will be set to an Evaluation Status of "Not Evaluated".  The exception are Experiments described as "SuperSeries", those are set to "No".</li>
	<li>GXD Curators will triage the newly loaded experiments to determine if the experiment should be indexed (Yes, No, Maybe).
	<li>At this point there are no plans to delete any of the loaded experiments even if Curators flag them with a "No" (i.e. don't index this one).</li>
</ul>
