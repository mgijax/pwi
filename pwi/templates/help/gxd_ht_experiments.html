<h3>GXD High-throughput Evaluation</h4>
<h4>Experiment Curation</h4>
<h5>Keyboard Shortcuts</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Search = Ctrl/Alt S</li>
    <li>Clear = Ctrl/Alt C</li>
    <li>Modify = Ctrl/Alt M</li>
	<li>Previous = Ctrl/Alt P</li>
	<li>Next = Ctrl/Alt N</li>
	<li>Last = Ctrl/Alt L</li>
</ul>

<h5>Color-coded Labels</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Blue/Green = fields that may be searched (but not modified).</li>
	<li>Green = fields that may be searched or modified by the Curator.</li>
	<li>Blue = read only fields</li>
	<li>Yellow = action buttons</li>
</ul>

<h5>Curation Status Fields</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluation = The primary curated field for Experiments.  The GXD Curator will determine whether or not they want to curate the Samples of this Experiment (Yes, No, Maybe).  
        This field is not displayed anywhere and does not determine whether Experiments are moved to Public.</li>
    <li>Curation State =  This field is set by the software and cannot be modified by the Curator.  Experiments with a Curation State = Done are moved to the Public WI.  
        Once an Experiment has curated samples -- the Curation State is updated to Done.  Until there is an ability to delete Samples (future enhancement) a Curator is unable to revert the state 
        to "Not Done".  Once the Curation State = Done the value of Evaluation State is irrelevant.</li>  
</ul>

<h5>ID Fields for an Experiment</h5>
<ul>
    <li>ArrayExp = experiment ID from ArrayExpress; you may link to this ID using the icon to the right of the input box.</li>
    <li>GEO = experiment ID from GEO; you may link to this ID using the icon to the right of the input box.</li>
    <li>PubMed = publication ID; you may click on this ID to link to PubMed; there may be 0-n PubMed IDs and this count is displayed next to the label. "Pub Med: n" 
</ul>

<h5>Curated Experiment Fields (Green)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Title = A Curator may modify the Title; likely will be limited to infrequent typo corrections as this field will be displayed in the Public WI.</li>
	<li>Description = A Curator may modify the Description; likely will be limited to infrequent typo corrections as this field will be displayed in the Public WI.</li>
	<li>Experiment Note = A text field used at the discretion of the Curator.  This text is displayed in the WI when present.</li>
	<li>Experiment Type = A Curator may modify the Experiment Type.  The value displayed in the "Green" Experiment Type is the one that the Load set.  The value(s) displayed in the "Grey" Experiment Type are the ones downloaded from ArrayExpress.</li>
	<li>Study Type = A Curator selects the appropriate Study Type of the Experiment when curating the Sample Data.  The load sets this field to "Not Curated".</li>
	<li>Experimental Variables = The items listed are defined in a Simple Vocabulary, the abbreviations are used to save space.  A Curator may select 0-to-many terms.  The load sets this field to "Not Curated".</li>
</ul>

<h5>Date Fields</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Creation in GXD = Date this experiment was loaded in the MGD database.</li>
    <li>Release = Date set by ArrayExpress</li>
    <li>Last update = Date set by ArrayExpress</li>
    <li>Evaluated = Most recent date that the Evaluation Status was modified.  Modifications to any other curated Experiment fields not tracked by this date field (e.g. Title, Study Type, etc).</li>
    <li>Initial Curation = Date the first curation of this Experiment's Samples occurs.</li>
    <li>Last Curation = Most recent date that the curated Sample Data was modified.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Search by Dates (Creation in GXD, Release, Evaluated, Initial Curation, etc)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Valid date formats:
	<ul><li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
	    <li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
	    <li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Searching for a range of dates:
	<ul><li>equal to:  enter a single date</li>
	    <li>greater than:  > mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>greater than or equal to:  >= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>less than:  < mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>less than or equal to:  <= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	    <li>between two dates (inclusive):  mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>Search with Wildcards</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The wildcard character is %.</li>
    <li>You may append or prepend the wildcard (%) to your search text.</li>
    <li>A wildcard may be used in text, date, and ID searches.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Samples - Raw & Curated</h4>

<h5>Raw Samples: Download sample metadata</h5>

<ul>
   <li>A raw sample table is downloaded by clicking 1 of 2 links - with or without consolidation.  The number of columns and content will vary between experiments -- the columns are named and defined by the submitters of the data.</li>
   <li>Not all Experiments have Samples that require consolidation.  Counts are displayed at the top of the raw sample table that informs the Curator whether or not consolidation has occurred.</li>
   <li>If required, consolidation is done most commonly by Source Name.  In the rare cases of Samples not having a Source Name the Assay Name will be used.  If there is no Assay Name, then Extract Name is used for consolidation.</li>
   <li>Consolidated Samples with multiple (non-duplicated) values will be delimited by pipes (|).</li>
   <li>If a Curator determines that the samples should not be consolidated for curation they should redisplay the experiment and click on "Download sample metadata no consolidation".</li>
   <li>Downloading sample metadata after samples have been curated...</li>
</ul>


<h5>Curate Samples</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Curation of Samples happens when 2 actions occur: clicking on the "Curate Samples" link and clicking on "Modify".  Once these actions are taken this experiment and samples will be moved to the Public WI.</li>
    <li>Clicking on the Curate Samples link displays a table of curated sample fields.  A curator may alter the default display by checking/unchecking boxes.  These selections will be maintained until another experiment is selected.</li>
    <li>If a Curator selects a different experiment before saving one that is in progress -- no samples are saved.</li>
    
</ul>

<h5>Sample Fields & Validation</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Name:  default most commonly the Source Name; may be Assay Name or Extract Name if Source Name does not exist; Curator may reenter this field if desired.</li>
    <li>Organism:  selection from pull-down list of controlled vocabulary</li>
    <li>GXD Relevant?:  selection from pull-down of controlled vocabulary</li>
    <li>Genotype: Genotype ID entered with or without "MGI:"; validation and display of genotype when clicking or tabbing out.</li>
    <li>Age Unit: selection from pull-down of controlled vocabulary</li>
    <li>Age Range: free-form text field; valid values differ by Age Unit; Warning in place for alpha entry.</li>
    <li>Sex: selection from pull-down of controlled vocabulary</li>
    <li>EMAPS: term selected from the clipboard or ID entered.  Validation performed when tabbing out.  Reset to blank by clicking out.</li>
    <li>Note: optional free form text.</li>
    <li>
</ul>

<h5>UI features</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Toggle columns on/off: available for curated and raw columns either by check box or X at top of column.</li>
    <li>Column sort: available for curated and raw columns</li>
    <li>Filters: available for raw columns only</li>
    <li>Clipboard: updates to the EMAPA clipboard are recognized once the Refresh Clipboard link is clicked.</li>
    <li>Copy Up/Down: available for curated columns; clicking on an arrow replicates the value from that cell for all cells above or below (depending on which arrow used).</li>
    <li>Copy from Above: available for curated columns; tabbing out of a field will pull in the value from a cell above.</li>

</ul>

<h4>GXD HT Experiment Load Overview</h4>
<p>
This is an incremental load of high-throughput experiments from ArrayExpress.  These are being loaded for the purpose
of indexing some of them using standard vocabularies for the meta data of the experiment.  It is expected that users will query GXD to 
find interesting experiments, but will go to the source for the details of the experiment itself. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only experiments for mus and select assay types are loaded.</li>
    <li>The load runs on a regular weekly schedule.</li>
	<li>Most of the newly loaded experiments will be set to an Evaluation Status of "Not Evaluated".  The exceptions are Experiments described as "SuperSeries", those are set to "No" 
	    and Experiments with a PubMed ID in MasterBib, those are set to "Maybe".</li>
	<li>GXD Curators will triage the newly loaded experiments to determine if the experiment should be indexed (Yes, No, Maybe).
	<li>At this point there are no plans to delete any of the loaded experiments even if Curators flag them with a "No" (i.e. don't index this one).</li>
	<li>Once loaded into the MGI database experiments are not updated via the Experiment Load with one exception:  the PubMed ID field may be updated if new values are detected at ArrayExpress or GEO.</li>
</ul>
