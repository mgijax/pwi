	<li>Images are displayed at the full size uploaded.</li>
	<li>When present, links to GenePaint or GUDMAP are displayed under "Other Database Links".</li>
	<li>Assay Data table order:
	<ul>
		<li>Rows are ordered alphanumerically by pane label.</li>
		<li>Assay &amp; Gene data for a pane are ordered by Assay ID, ascending (roughly, from first entered to last entered).</li>
	</ul>

	<li>Links in the "Copyright" data are displayed with P-WI external link formatting.</li>
	<li>The "Elsevier" tag, "DXDOI" tag, and other tags in the "Copyright" data are translated and displayed as on Public.</li>
