<h4>P-WI Image Summary functionality:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>This page is accessed only via the link on an Allele Detail Page. The URL supports <em>/pwi/summary/image?allele_id=MGI:(number)</em>. An Image Summary for an allele is the only Image Summary type supported; no other Image Summary type pages exist.</li>
	<li>The page includes all images associated with an allele, whether directly associated or associated through a genotype in which the allele participates. The page exists for any allele having at least 1  supported image.</li>
	<li>For a given allele, the following image types are displayed:
	<ul>
		<li>class = molecular (may be only 0 or 1 by curation policy (new Jan. 2015))</li>
		<li>class = phenotypes (may be 0 or more)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Images are sorted by
	<ol>
		<li>class (molecular before phenotypes)</li>
		<li>primary ("yes" before "no")</li>
		<li>associated object (allele before genotypes)</li>
	</ol> 
	</li>
	<li>For each image set, the thumbnail image is shown, followed by the fullsize image.</li>
	<li>Thumbnail images are shown at actual size.  Fullsize images are scaled down so that the width never exceeds 400px. Actual dimensions are stated.</li>
	<li>Images may appear to be duplicated on the page because an image may be associated with the allele directly, or may be associated with 1 or more genotypes involving the allele. All are displayed.</li>
	<li>The Caption field does the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Use Notes Tag Converter for \AlleleSymbol tags, then convert angle brackets to superscript HTML tags.</li>
		<li>Interpret HTML for &lt;sup&gt; tags and others as entered by curators.</li>
		<li>B2B alleles include HTML with javascript to play movie from YouTube in the page. These are handled similar to the Public Image Detail page: clicking the "Play Video" link fires the javascript code. It replaces the linked text with the YouTube player and plays the designated video within the page at the designated size. (Note: this may occlude some or all of the Caption text. Reload the page to remove the YouTube player and view the text again.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Copyright field does the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Interpret HTML for &lt;a&gt; tags (and others?) as entered by curators.</li>
		<li>Translate any Notes Tags (e.g., \JBiolChem(8663429|JBC|), \JLipidRes(10884287|JLR|), etc.)
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>Associated Data:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>All alleles directly associated with each image.</li>
	<li>Image records may also be associated with genotype records. Genotypes are not listed.</li>
</ul>
