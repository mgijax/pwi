<h4>P-WI Image Summary functionality:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The page includes all images associated with an allele, whether directly associated or associated through a genotype in which the allele participates.</li>
	<li>For a given allele, the following image types are displayed:
	<ul>
		<li>class = molecular</li>
		<li>class = phenotypes</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Images are sorted by class (molecular before phenotypes), then by primary ("yes" before "no"), then by database _image_key descending (to put newest images before older ones).</li>
	<li>For each image set, the thumbnail image is shown, followed by the fullsize image.</li>
	<li>Thumbnail images are shown at actual size.  Fullsize images are scaled down so that the width never exceeds 400px. Actual dimensions are stated.</li>
	<li>This page is accessed only via the link on an Allele Detail Page. The URL supports <em>/pwi/summary/image?allele_id=MGI:(number)</em>. An Image Summary for an allele is the only Image Summary type supported; no other Image Summary type pages exist.</li>
	<li>The Caption field does the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Use Notes Tag Converter for \AlleleSymbol tags.</li>
		<li>Interpret HTML for &lt;sup&gt; tags and others.</li>
		<li>B2B alleles include HTML with javascript to play movie from YouTube in the page. These are handled as they are on the Public Image Detail page: clicking the "Play Video" link fires the javascript code to replace the image file with the YouTube player and plays the designated video within the page at the designated size.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Copyright field does the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Interpret HTML for &lt;a&gt; tags (and others?).</li>
		<li>Translate any Notes Tags (e.g., \JBiolChem(8663429|JBC|), \JLipidRes(10884287|JLR|), etc.)
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>Associated Data:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>All alleles associated with each image.</li>
</ul>
