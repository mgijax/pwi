<h3>Literature Triage Functionality:</h3>

<h4>General Description</h4>

<h4>Keyboard Short-cuts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>TBD</li>
</ul>

<h4>Color-coded Labels</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Blue/Green = fields that may be search (but not modified)</li>
  <li>Blue = Read only fields</li>
  <li>Yellow = Action buttons</li>
</ul>

<h4>Searching References (Master BIB)</h4>
<p>
Fields that may be used for searching have labels highlighted in blue/green.  They may be searched individually or in 
combination.  Multiple field entries are treated as an AND search.  A wildcard (%) may be used at the beginning and/or end of your
search text.  Wildcards may be used for most fields.  Exceptions are Accession IDs, Reference Type, Review?, and Year.  
</p>

<h5>Search by Accession IDs</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Valid types of IDs: J number, DOI, PubMed, GO_REF, MGI Reference</li>
  <li>Prefix required for J numbers, GO_REF, MGI Reference IDs (e.g. J:, GO_REF:, MGI:)</li>
  <li>A single or list of IDs may be entered.  The IDs may be of one type or a mix.</li>
  <li>Lists may be delimited by comma, space, or newline/CR</li>
  <li>Exact limit to number of IDs that can be entered is unknown, but tests were done with over 6,000 successfully.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Search by Dates</h5>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>Date</i> field is a text field downloaded from PubMed.  The format can vary, but is typically YYYY Mon DD.  Wildcards may be used.</li>
  <li>The <i>Year</i> field is a numeric field downloaded from PubMed.  The format is YYYY.  A single year may be entered.  
      Ranges have not been enabled and wildcards are not accepted.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Search by Workflow Status</h5>
<ul>
  <li>One or more <i>Status</i> fields may be checked for a search.</li>
  <li>When more than one <i>Status</i> box has been checked the search will treat them as an OR search.  If other fields are included in the search those are treated as an AND.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reference Display</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Summary Table of Results</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Journal:  DOI ID with a link to doi.org</li>
    <li>PMID:  PubMedID with a link to PubMed</li>
    <li>J:#:  an MGI assigned J number</li>
    <li>Link to PDF:  a link icon in the J# column</li>
    <li>Short Citation:  Includes Primary Author, Journal, Date, Volume, Issue, Pages</li>
    <li>Title:  Title of reference</li>
    <li>Status Codes:  TBD</li>  
  </ol>
  <li>Reference Details</li>
  <p>Detailed information is displayed for the single highlighted reference in the list of references returned in the Summary table.
     By default this reference is the first one returned.  A user may use the Prev/Next buttons or their mouse to select another reference
     to view.</p>
  <li>PDF downloads/viewing</li>
  <li>Download list of references (text file)</li>
</ul>
