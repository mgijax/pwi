<h2>P-WI Marker Editor Interface functionality:</h2>

<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
The Marker module is a search, display and edit page all in one. A User must be logged in to edit but can search without logging in.

</p><h4>Keyboard Short-cuts</h4>
There are reported issues using these short-cuts with Mac/Firefox. 
<ul>
	<li>Search = Ctrl-Alt-S</li>
	<li>Clear = Ctrl-Alt-C</li>
	<li>Modify = Ctrl-Alt-M</li>
	<li>Previous = Ctrl-Alt-P</li>
	<li>Next = Ctrl-Alt-N</li>
	
</ul>

<h4>Color-coded Labels</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Blue/Green = fields that may be searched (but not modified)</li>
	<li>Green = fields that may be modified by the Curator</li>
	<li>Blue = Read-only fields</li>
	<li>Yellow = Action buttons</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Chrome and FireFox are supported on both PC and Mac computers.</li>
	<li>Safari is NOT supported for the PWI. There are features that do not work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>
All fields that have labels highlighted in blue/green may be used for searching. They may be searched individually or in 
combination. To include data in a tab in a search: click on the tab to expand it and enter text to be searched. At least one search field must be entered or an error message is displayed. When more than one field is used in a search, it 
is treated as an AND search. e.g. Marker Type = Gene AND Symbol = Pax%.
</p>

<h4>Limit on # of results</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The Marker module is currently configured to restrict the number of results to 1,000 references. It may be preferable to use more search fields to reduce the number of results returned.</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Wildcards</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Wildcards may be used for most fields. </li>
	<li>A wildcard (%) may be used at the beginning, middle and/or end of your search text: e.g. %paired%, casein% or AK32%43%.</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Search by Accession IDs</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Valid types of IDs: MGI Marker, MGD-MRK IDs, EC IDs and Sequence DB IDs.</li>
	
	
	
</ul>

<h4>Search by Dates</h4>
<ul>
	

	
	
	<li>Valid date formats for searching are:
		<ul>
			<li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
			<li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
			<li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Searching for a range of dates:
		<ul>
			<li>equal to: enter a single date</li>
			<li>greater than: &gt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>greater than or equal to: &gt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than: &lt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than or equal to: &lt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>between two dates (inclusive): mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			</ul>
	</li>

	

</ul> 

 
<ul>
	<li>The History Event Date field only accepts one format YYYY-MM-DD. The date formats used by other fields do not apply to this field</li>
	 
</ul>

<h4>Search by Marker History</h4> 
<ul>
	<li>The Created By (User) and Modified By (User) may be searched using the curator (or database load) user name.</li>
	<li>The Creation Date and Modification Date may be searched in any of the following formats:</li> 
	<li>Valid date formats for searching are:
		<ul>
			<li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
			<li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
			<li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A range of dates may also be searched:
		<ul>
			<li>equal to: enter a single date</li>
			<li>greater than: &gt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>greater than or equal to: &gt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than: &lt; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than or equal to: &lt;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>between two dates (inclusive): mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Search Results</h4>
<p>When a user clicks on the Search button or presses Enter/Return on the keyboard, the results are displayed in a table under the Search button on the right side of the page. The 
		table displays the results in alpha numeric order. The highlighted result is the
		one that is displayed in detail on the left side. A user can highlight a different result 
		by clicking on a different row or using Ctrl+Alt+N or Ctrl+Alt+P to scroll down and up the results. Hovering the cursor in the results table will allow the user to scroll up or down the table of results with a mouse.
	</p>

<h4>Detail Results</h4>

	<p>Detailed information is displayed on the left side of the page in the Marker Detail section.
		By default, the marker highlighted on the right is the first one returned and displayed. (A user must be logged in to Modify a reference.
		When not logged in the Modify, Create and Delete buttons are greyed out. Create stays greyed out unless new data is being entered.)</p>
		
<h3>Adding New Data</h3>
<ul>
	
	<li>Adding a new marker requires a unique symbol, a name, a marker type, a marker status and a chromosome.</li>
	<li>J:23000 is the default reference if you don't enter one when creating a new marker.</li>
<li>Feature Type (TDC) can be selected from the feature type drop down list. The marker types and which feature types are allowed with them are listed at the bottom of this document.</li>
	<li>A marker cannot be created if the symbol already exists.</li>
	<li>Adding a marker of type "Gene" and status "Official" always creates a wild-type allele for the gene.</li>
	<li>If Chromosome is set to "UN" the cmOffset is set to -999, if Chromosome is not set to "UN" the cmOffset is set to -1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modifying fields</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Marker Status cannot be changed to "Withdrawn" by the Modify button.</li>
	
	<li>Marker Status cannot be changed from "Official" to "Reserved" if the marker has annotations associated to it.</li>
	<li>If Marker Status is being changed from "Reserved" to "Official" and Marker Type is "Gene" and a Wild-type allele does not exist and Marker 
	Name does not contain (mt, withdrawn, dna sequence, EST, expressed sequence, cDNA sequence, gene model, hypothetical protein, 
	ecotropic viral intergration site, or viral polymerase), then create the wild-type allele.</li>
	<li>The Modify button is used to update/create/remove editor notes, sequence notes, marker revision notes, strain-specific notes, location notes, change the chromosome, marker type, marker status, add/remove feature types and correct typos in the symbol and name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sections of the page</h3>
<h4>Right side</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This part of the page contains the searchable fields MGI ID, Created by, Modified by, Creation Date, Modification Date and the action buttons Search, Clear, Reset Search, Create, Modify, Delete.</li><li>Clear resets the page. Reset Search removes items returned from a search but keeps the last search parameters. You must be logged in to use Create, Modify and Delete.</li>
</ul>
	<h4>Marker Detail</h4>
<ul>
    <il>The top left part of the page contains drop down lists of Marker Type, Marker Status, Chromosome and Feature Type. Below the drop down lists are Symbol, Name, Cytogenetic Band and cM Position fields.
</il></ul>
<h4>Notes Tabs</h4><ul><li>Editor Notes, Sequence Notes, Marker Revision Notes, Strain-Specific Notes, and Location Notes are all tabs immediately under the upper left Marker Detail section.</li><li>Clicking on a note will open a text field and allow creation of a new note. Click the 
    <b>Modify</b>
    button to save any changes.</li><li>If a note is already present, the tab title is in green instead of black font.</li><li>The Strain-Specific Notes appear on the public marker detail pages.</li></ul>
<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>

<h4>History Table</h4>
<ul>
<li>This table appears below the notes tabs. It contains the fields #, Symbol, Name, Date, J#, Citation, Event, Reason, Modified By. The fields populate when a Utility function (see below) is used.</li>
<li>Even though the Symbol, Name, Date, J#, Event, and Reason fields are all editable, they should not be under normal circumstances and in accordance with best practices.</li>
<li>The Symbol and J# fields are validated. Validation happens once you tab out of the field or click in another field. If the field does not validate the user is presented with an error. The Modify button is disabled upon a validation error and re-enabled once a validated entry is entered. As a visual clue, the Modify button is greyed out when there is a validation error.</li>
<li>The Citation and Modified By fields are not editable.</li>
<li>The # field can be edited but must validate before it can be modified: Numbers can be switched among rows, but no two rows are allowed to have the same number and a new number larger than that of the last row cannot be used. Once modified, the rows are resorted by # numbers into their new sort order.</li>
<li>A History line can be added by clicking the <b>Add</b> button. The symbol must already exist in the database or you will get an error message. A valid reference must be added to the J# field. The user can <b>Commit</b> or <b>Cancel</b> adding the new history line. After committing the history line, it will appear in the history table. After using <b>Modify</b> to add the new line, it will appear in the last row of history. The rows can be reordered by editing the # column and modifying again.</li>
</ul><h4>Other Tabs</h4>
