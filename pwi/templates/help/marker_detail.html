<h4>P-WI Marker Detail functionality:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The Marker Detail page displays data for any marker in the Marker tables.</li>
	<li>The URL supports <em>/detail/marker/MGI:(number)</em> or <em>/detail/marker/key/(number)</em>.</li>
	<li>Mouse markers have MGI IDs and database key values.</li>
	<li>Markers for other organisms have database key values but not MGI IDs.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Summary Links:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Alleles - includes all private and public alleles associated directly with the marker. Does not include "expresses" or other relationships.</li>
	<li>References - includes references to which the marker is directly associated with the value "General" or "Strain Specific" as well as references associated with the marker via alleles, GO annotations, GXD Lit Index, probes, etc.</li>
	<li>GXD/Cre Assays - includes all GXD and Cre assays where the marker is the Assayed Gene.</li>
	<li>GXD/Cre Results - includes all GXD and Cre assay results where the marker is the Assayed Gene.</li>
	<li>Probes</li>
	<li>Antibodies</li>
	<li>Mapping Experiments - includes only specific experiment types.</li>
