<h4>P-WI Marker Query and Summary functionality:</h4>
<p>The Marker  Query and Summary page returns Mouse markers from the Marker tables matching your text in the Name, Symbol, or Synonyms fields.</p> 
<p>It also returns markers from the Nomen tables that match your text in the Name, Symbol, or Synonyms fields and have one of the following status values:</p>
<ul>
<li>in progress</li>
<li>deleted</li>
<li>reserved</li>
<li>approved</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the first 5,000 matching records are displayed. To get all results if more than 5,000 records match, click the "View All Matches" link at the top of each table.</p>
<h4>Marker Summary for a Reference functionality:</h4>
<p>Only markers DIRECTLY annotated to the Reference are included. <em>IS THIS TRUE?? 11/12/2014</em></p>
<p>Markers associated with a Reference via alleles, genotypes, or other paths are not included.</p>
<p>(The other objects will be added as links from the Reference Summary page as the project makes progress.)</p>
