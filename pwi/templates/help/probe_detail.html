<h4>P-WI Probe Detail Functionality:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Displays molecular probe/clone data.</li>
	<li>Includes all fields from the EI unless stated below.</li>
	<li>Names are displayed verbatim.</li>
	<li>Primers include fewer fields than cDNA, genomic, and other probe types.</li>
	<li>Raw Sequence Notes are not displayed.</li>
	<li>In general, fields are labeled and presented in the same order as in the corresponding EI Modules.</li>
