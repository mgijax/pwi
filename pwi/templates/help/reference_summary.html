<h4>P-WI Reference Query and Summary functionality:</h4>
<p>The Reference Summary does not include special data fields associated with BOOKS.</p>
<p>Sort order: database key, descending (reverse order of being added to the database).</p>
<p>Only the first 250 matching records are displayed. If additional rows exist, click the "View All Reference Matches" link at the top of the table, or download the tab-delimited file.</p>
<h5>Associated Data:</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Alleles: includes only Alleles where Reference type is "Indexed", "Original", "Molecular", "Expression only", "Transmission", "Used-FC" (e.g., J:208092 has 6 on both systems; J:206084 has 7 in P-WI but 11 on Public).</li>
	<li>Markers: includes all Markers:
	<ul>
		<li>where Reference relationship type is "General"  or &quot;Strain Specific&quot;.</li>
		<li>indirectly associated to the Reference through other objects including assays, alleles, GXD lit index, GO annotations, probes, nomen, and mapping data. </li>
		<li>Does not include associations to GO annotated terms themselves.</li>
	</ul> 
	</li>
	<li>GXD/Cre Assays: includes all GXD expression assays and Cre activity assays associated with the reference.</li>
	<li>Antibodies</li>
	<li>Probes (molecular segments)</li>
	<li><strike>Mapping experiments</strike> <em>- mapping data summaries exist only for a marker</em></li>
</ul>
<h5>Reference Summary for MGI Object</h5>
<ul>
	<li>For a marker, the supported URL is <em>/pwi/summary/reference?marker_id=MGI:(number)</em>
	<li>For an allele, the supported URL is <em>/pwi/summary/reference?allele_id=MGI:(number)</em>
</ul>
