<h4>P-WI Edit Variant functionality:</h4>

<h4>General Description</h4>
<p>
The Variant module is a search, edit, display page all in one.  Each variant is related to a single allele, while an
allele can have multiple variants.  Detail for these variants may be viewed and edited one at a time (not all variants
at once for a given allele).

<h4>Keyboard Short-cuts</h4>
There are reported issues using these short-cuts with Mac/Firefox. 
<ul>
	<li>Search = Ctrl/Alt S</li>
	<li>Clear = Ctrl/Alt C</li>
	<li>Modify = Ctrl/Alt M</li>
	<li>Previous = Ctrl/Alt P</li>
	<li>Next = Ctrl/Alt N</li>
	<li>Associate Tag = Ctrl/Alt T</li>
</ul>

<h4>Color-coded Labels</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Blue/Green = fields that may be searched (but not modified)</li>
	<li>Green = fields that may be modified by the Curator</li>
	<li>Blue = Read only fields</li>
	<li>Yellow = Action buttons</li>
</ul>

<h4>Supported Browsers</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Chrome and FireFox are supported on both PC and Mac computers.</li>
	<li>Safari is NOT supported for the PWI. There are features that do not work.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Searching</h4>
<p>
All fields that have labels highlighted in blue/green and may be used for searching. They may be searched individually or in 
combination. At least 1 search field must be entered or an error message is displayed. When more than 1 field is used in a search, it 
is treated as an AND search. (i.e.- <i>All</i> entered fields must match the variants to be returned.) 
</p>

<h5>Limit on # of results</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The Variant module is currently configured to restrict the number of results to 1,001 variants. It may be preferable to use more search fields to reduce the number of results returned.</li>
</ul> 

<h5>Wildcards</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Wildcards may be used for most fields. Exceptions include: <i>Accession IDs</i>, <i>Creation Date</i>,
	and <i>Modification Date</i>.</li>
	<li>A wildcard (%) may be used at the beginning and/or end of your search text. E.g. %paired% or casein% </li>
</ul> 

<h5>Search by Accession IDs</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Valid types of IDs: MGI Allele</li>
	<li>A single or list of IDs may be entered. The IDs may be of one type or a mix.</li>
	<li>Lists may be delimited by comma, space, or newline/carriage return</li>
	<li>A list of IDs may be entered using Cut/Paste from an Excel file or QC report.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Search by Dates</h5>
<ul>
	<li>The Creation and Modification Dates are time stamps held in the database.</li>
	
	<li>Valid date formats for searching are:
		<ul>
			<li>mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy</li>
			<li>mm/dd/yy or mm-dd-yy</li>
			<li>yyyy/mm/dd or yyyy-mm-dd</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Searching for a range of dates:
		<ul>
			<li>equal to: enter a single date</li>
			<li>greater than: &#62; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>greater than or equal to: &#62;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than: &#60; mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>less than or equal to: &#60;= mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>between two dates (inclusive): mm/dd/yyyy..mm/dd/yyyy</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Search Results</h4>
<p>When you click on the Search button, the results are displayed in a table with each row representing a single
	variant.  The table displays the variants, through the alleles they are attached to, in alpha numeric order. The variant highlighted in pale yellow(by default the first one) is the one that is
	displayed in detail in the main form. Youcan highlight a different variant by clicking on a different row.
	</p>
		
<h4>Adding New Data</h4>
<br>
<li>To create a new variant from scratch, start with a blank form (click <b>Clear</b> if necessary) and enter either
an <i>Allele ID</i> or <i>Allele Symbol</i> in their respective fields. Then either hit the TAB key or use the mouse to 
click out of the field to any other field. The missing allele value (either <i>ID</i> or <i>Symbol</i>) plus associated 
data (<i>References</i>, <i>Chromosome</i>, <i>Strand</i>) will now be retrieved and filled in. Allele data can now be filled 
in (see “Sourced and Curated Records Requirements” below for requirements). A variant record will only be created after clicking 
<b>Create</b>. Subsequent changes are saved by clicking <b>Modify</b> (the <b>Create</b> button will be grayed out once the record has been created).</li>
<li>To create a variant that is a copy of (or very similar to) an existing variant, but has to be attached to a different allele of the same gene, 
click the <b>Duplicate Variant</b> button on the form of the variant record you want to duplicate. This will create a new form with all the variant data of 
the original form but with only the allele gene symbol filled in for the allele data. Complete the <i>Allele Symbol</i> to represent the new allele you want 
the variant to be attached to. Then either hit the TAB key or use the mouse to click out of the field to any other field. The missing allele value (<i>Allele ID</i>) 
plus associated data (<i>References</i>, <i>Chromosome</i>, <i>Strand</i>) will now be retrieved and filled in. Modify variant data as necessary. A variant record will only be 
created after clicking <b>Create</b>. Subsequent changes are saved by clicking <b>Modify</b> (the <b>Create</b> button will be grayed out once the record has been created).</li>
<li>To create a new variant for an existing allele (i.e. you have an allele variant record open), click the <b>Duplicate Allele</b> button. A new form will be created with just 
the allele data from the previous form filled in; the variant fields will be empty. Allele data can now be filled in (see “Sourced and Curated Records Requirements” below 
for requirements). A variant record will only be created after clicking <b>Create</b>. Subsequent changes are saved by clicking <b>Modify</b> (the <b>Create</b> button will be grayed out once 
the record has been created). Once the new record has been created the ‘All variants’ table at the bottom will be updated with the new row of variant data added to the end of the table.</li>
<li>If you only provide Sourced info, then both Sourced and Curated records will be created but the Curated record will be empty; if you provide both Sourced and Curated info, then both 
records will be created and populated using Sourced and Curated info.
o	This means Sourced and Curated records will always be create regardless of whether you provide only Sourced or only Curated data, or both.</li> 
<br>
<h5>Modifying fields</h5>
<ul>
<li>All fields with a green label tab (except <i>Types</i> and <i>Effects</i>) accept keyboard or copy-pasted input.</li>
<li>To copy values from the As Sourced fields to the corresponding Curated fields, you can click the <b>Copy all</b> button to copy all data or click the <b>Coords</b> or <b>Alleles</b> button in the Genomic, 
Transcript or Polypeptide sections to copy only selected data. The <b>Coords</b> button copies only the coordinate data (<i>Genome Build/Transcript ID/Polypeptide ID, Start, End</i>) in that section to 
the corresponding Curated section; The <p style="text-decoration: underline bold blue;">Alleles</p> button copies only the Reference and Variant Allele data (sequence) in that section to the corresponding Curated section.</li>
<li>To enter amino acid sequence you can click the <b>Amino Acid Popup</b>. This will open a popup window with all the valid amino acids and their three-letter and one-letter codes. You can use this window to 
enter amino acids or use it just as a reference when using manual keyboard entry. If the former, click on any name or code to copy that value to the field that is active (i.e. with a pale yellow background). 
Note that the system will interpret full names and three-letter codes as strings of single-letter amino acid codes and, upon saving, capitalize all characters. So make sure that in the Polypeptide <i>Reference</i>
and <i>Variant Allele</i> fields you only use single-letter codes (upper or lower case). Full names or three-letter codes can be used in either of the <i>Notes</i> fields. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Allele Section</h4>
<ul>
<li>All fields are searchable.</li>
<li>A wildcard is allowed in the <i>Allele Symbol</i> field for searching.</li>
<li><i>Allele References</i> are displayed as a comma-separated list.</li>
<li>The <i>Strand</i> field will have a red background when the strand is "-".</li>

</ul>
<h4>Sourced and Curated Records Section Requirements</h4>

<li>You can enter nucleotide sequence in either upper or lower case; lower case letters are automatically capitalized upon saving.</li>
</ul>

Alternatively, click <b>Discard Changes and Close</b> (or the window close button top right) if you do not want to save the selection. If there is existing 
data in the <i>Types</i> field that selection will show up as selected in the popup window. Any modifications to existing selections will be reflected in 
the field after save and close. A variant can be of more than one type. Type SO terms are shown with the most common first, logically grouped.</li>
